---

Skills, slash commands, subagents, MCP servers. Claude Code now has four different ways to extend its capabilities, and if you're confused about which one to use, you're not alone.

I spent hours reading documentation only to realize the guides don't answer the fundamental question: **when should I use each one?** Worse, most tutorials completely ignore the progressive disclosure architecture—the design that gives skills a 98% token reduction when they're present but not activated.

Let me clear up the confusion and show you what nobody else explains.

## The Claude Code Extension Landscape

Before diving deep, here's the mental map you need:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CLAUDE CODE EXTENSIONS                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  SLASH COMMANDS          SKILLS             SUBAGENTS           │
│  ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐       │
│  │ /command    │      │ Auto-invoked│     │ Isolated    │       │
│  │ Manual      │      │ by Claude   │     │ context     │       │
│  │ Single file │      │ Directory   │     │ Workers     │       │
│  └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘       │
│         │                    │                   │              │
│         └────────────────────┼───────────────────┘              │
│                              │                                  │
│                     ┌────────┴────────┐                         │
│                     │   MCP SERVERS   │                         │
│                     │   (Tools layer) │                         │
│                     └─────────────────┘                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The key insight: **MCP provides the tools; Skills teach how to use them.** They're complementary, not competing.

## Skills vs Slash Commands vs Subagents vs MCP: Decision Framework

Here's the decision tree I wish existed when I started:

| Need                                          | Use This       | Why                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Explicit control over when something runs** | Slash Commands | You type `/command`, it runs. Predictable.             |
| **Claude should decide when to invoke**       | Skills         | Claude matches task to skill description automatically |
| **Isolated context for focused work**         | Subagents      | Fresh 200K context window, returns summary             |
| **Connect to external services/data**         | MCP            | Protocol for databases, APIs, file systems             |
| **Teach Claude how to use tools effectively** | Skills + MCP   | Skills provide procedural knowledge for MCP tools      |

### The Merged Reality (Claude Code 2.1+)

Here's something most guides miss: **Claude Code 2.1 merged skills and slash commands.** Skills now appear in the slash command menu by default, giving you explicit invocation via `/skill-name`.

This means the "skills vs slash commands" distinction is largely obsolete for invocation. The real difference is:

- **Slash commands:** Single markdown file, simple prompts
- **Skills:** Directory with multiple files, progressive disclosure, bundled resources

### When to Use Each

**Use Slash Commands when:**

- Task is simple and repeatable
- You always want explicit control
- Single prompt is sufficient
- No supporting files needed

**Use Skills when:**

- Task requires context Claude should load on-demand
- You have templates, scripts, or reference materials
- Multiple team members need consistent behavior
- Cross-platform compatibility matters (Skills are an open standard)

**Use Subagents when:**

- Task needs isolated context (research, exploration)
- You want parallel execution
- Task shouldn't pollute main conversation
- Results can be summarized back

**Use MCP when:**

- Connecting to external services
- Database access
- API integrations
- File system operations beyond local project

## How Progressive Disclosure Actually Works

This is the architecture that delivers 98% token savings—and almost nobody explains it properly.

Skills load in three stages:

### Stage 1: Metadata Scanning (~100 tokens)

At startup, Claude only loads the `name` and `description` from each skill's YAML frontmatter. That's it.

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewing
description: Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and style violations
---
```

With 10 skills installed, you're paying ~1,000 tokens total—not the 50,000+ you'd pay if everything loaded upfront.

### Stage 2: Full Instructions (Under 5K tokens)

When Claude determines a skill applies to the current task (via semantic matching on the description), it loads the full `SKILL.md` content.

**This is why descriptions matter so much.** Vague descriptions = skill never triggers. Trigger-rich descriptions = Claude knows exactly when to activate.

```yaml
# ❌ Too vague - won't trigger reliably
description: Helps with code

# ✅ Trigger-rich - clear activation conditions
description: Reviews TypeScript and JavaScript code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and adherence to team coding standards when user asks for code review or mentions reviewing changes
```

### Stage 3: Bundled Resources (On-demand)

Supporting files (templates, scripts, reference docs) only load when the skill explicitly references them and the task requires them.

```markdown
# In SKILL.md

When reviewing authentication code, consult `./security-checklist.md` for the full OWASP verification list.
```

The `security-checklist.md` file sits at zero tokens until Claude actually needs it.

**The math:** You can include 10+ skills in your setup, but only pay for the ones Claude activates on each request.

## Anatomy of a Well-Structured SKILL.md

Every skill needs at minimum a `SKILL.md` file in a dedicated folder:

```
.claude/skills/
└── code-reviewing/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Required
    ├── security-checklist.md   # Optional reference
    ├── style-guide.md     # Optional reference
    └── templates/         # Optional templates
        └── review-report.md
```

### The Essential Structure

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewing
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and coding standard violations when user requests code review
---

# Code Reviewing

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:

- Explicitly asks for code review
- Mentions "review these changes"
- Asks about security or performance of specific code

## Review Process

### Step 1: Security Analysis

Check for:

- SQL injection vectors
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypasses
- Exposed secrets

### Step 2: Performance Review

Look for:

- N+1 query patterns
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Memory leaks
- Blocking operations

### Step 3: Style Compliance

Verify against team standards in `./style-guide.md`

## Output Format

Present findings as:

1. **Critical** - Must fix before merge
2. **Warning** - Should address
3. **Suggestion** - Nice to have

## References

- Security details: `./security-checklist.md`
- Style guide: `./style-guide.md`
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - Split detailed content into referenced files
2. **Use gerund naming** - `code-reviewing` not `code-reviewer`
3. **Write trigger-rich descriptions** - Include specific keywords Claude matches against
4. **Structure for scanning** - Clear headings, numbered steps, bullet points
5. **Reference don't embed** - Put large content in separate files

## Building Your First Skill

Let's build a practical skill: a PR description generator that follows your team's template.

### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/pr-describing
```

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: pr-describing
description: Generates pull request descriptions following team template when user creates PR or asks for PR description
---

# PR Description Generator

## Activation Triggers

Use this skill when user:

- Says "create PR" or "open PR"
- Asks for "PR description"
- Mentions "pull request" with intent to create

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

Use git diff to understand:

- Files modified
- Nature of changes (feature, fix, refactor)
- Breaking changes

### Step 2: Generate Description

Follow the template in `./pr-template.md`

### Step 3: Add Context

- Link related issues
- Tag reviewers if mentioned
- Add appropriate labels

## Template Reference

See `./pr-template.md` for the exact format.
```

### Step 3: Create Supporting Template

```markdown
<!-- .claude/skills/pr-describing/pr-template.md -->

## Summary

[2-3 sentences describing what this PR does]

## Changes

- [ ] Change 1
- [ ] Change 2

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing performed

## Screenshots

[If UI changes]

## Related Issues

Closes #[issue-number]
```

### Step 4: Test It

```bash
# In Claude Code
"Create a PR for my current changes"
```

Claude will automatically load the skill based on the description match.

## MCP + Skills Integration Pattern

Here's the pattern most developers miss: using Skills to teach Claude how to effectively use MCP tools.

### The Problem

MCP gives Claude access to tools (database queries, API calls), but Claude doesn't know your specific:

- Data models
- Query patterns
- API conventions
- Error handling preferences

### The Solution

Create skills that provide procedural knowledge for MCP tools:

````markdown
---
name: database-querying
description: Executes database queries using the postgres MCP server following team conventions
---

# Database Query Skill

## Prerequisites

Requires `postgres` MCP server connection.

## Data Model Reference

Our main tables:

- `users` - id, email, created_at, subscription_tier
- `orders` - id, user_id, amount, status, created_at
- `products` - id, name, price, category

## Query Conventions

### Always Use

- Parameterized queries (never string concatenation)
- LIMIT clauses (default 100, max 1000)
- Created_at DESC for time-series data

### Never Use

- SELECT \* (always specify columns)
- DELETE without WHERE
- UPDATE without transaction

## Common Patterns

### User lookup

```sql
SELECT id, email, subscription_tier
FROM users
WHERE email = $1
```
````

### Order history

```sql
SELECT o.id, o.amount, o.status, o.created_at
FROM orders o
WHERE o.user_id = $1
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50
```

````

Now when Claude uses the postgres MCP server, it has context about your specific data model and conventions.

## When Skills Fail to Trigger: Debugging Guide

Skills not activating is the most common frustration. Here's the systematic debugging approach.

### Check 1: Description Match

Claude uses semantic matching on descriptions. If your skill isn't triggering:

```yaml
# Test with explicit keywords
description: >
  Handles code review, PR review, merge request review,
  reviewing changes, checking code quality, security audit
````

Add synonyms and variations of how users might phrase the request.

### Check 2: Skill Location

Skills must be in the correct directory:

| Location            | Scope                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | All projects (user-level) |
| `.claude/skills/`   | Current project only      |

Verify with:

```bash
ls -la .claude/skills/
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Check 3: YAML Syntax

YAML errors fail silently. Validate your frontmatter:

```yaml
# ❌ Missing quotes around special characters
description: Reviews "code" for issues

# ✅ Properly quoted
description: 'Reviews "code" for issues'
```

### Check 4: Skill vs Command Conflict

If a slash command has the same name as a skill, the command takes precedence. Rename one.

### Check 5: Test Explicit Invocation

Since skills appear in slash command menu:

```bash
/pr-describing
```

If explicit invocation works but auto-triggering doesn't, the issue is your description.

## Team Workflows: Versioning and Sharing Skills

### Version Control Strategy

Commit skills to your repository:

```
project/
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── code-reviewing/
│       ├── pr-describing/
│       └── testing/
├── src/
└── ...
```

This ensures all team members work with consistent standards.

### Sharing Across Projects

For organization-wide skills, use the global directory with symlinks:

```bash
# Create shared skills repo
git clone git@github.com:your-org/claude-skills.git ~/shared-claude-skills

# Symlink to global location
ln -s ~/shared-claude-skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Publishing to Community

Anthropic's official marketplace:

1. Fork `github.com/anthropics/skills`
2. Add your skill following their structure
3. Submit PR

Or contribute to community collections like `awesome-claude-skills`.

## Real-World: Hugging Face's 1,000 Experiments/Day Setup

This isn't hypothetical—Hugging Face's ML teams use Claude Code skills to run over 1,000 experiments daily.

### Their Architecture

```
skills/
├── model-training/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── sft-config.yaml
│   ├── dpo-config.yaml
│   └── rlhf-config.yaml
├── experiment-tracking/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── wandb-templates/
└── deployment/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── gguf-conversion.py
```

### Key Features

1. **Skills registry** - Single source of truth for experimental knowledge
2. **Multi-stage pipelines** - SFT → DPO → RLHF in one conversation
3. **Parameter ranges** - 0.5B to 70B models
4. **Automated reporting** - PPTX generation for findings

### Results

What took 2-3 weeks of setup now takes 2 days. The skills capture institutional knowledge that would otherwise live only in senior engineers' heads.

## The Open Standard Advantage

On December 18, 2025, Anthropic published Agent Skills as an open standard at agentskills.io.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

Skills you write for Claude Code work in:

- OpenCode
- Cursor
- Amp
- Letta
- goose
- GitHub Copilot
- VS Code

This isn't vendor lock-in—it's portable expertise.

### Industry Adoption

The homepage already lists integrations from OpenAI Codex, Google's Gemini CLI, and the Hugging Face ecosystem. Write once, use everywhere.

### Enterprise Features

Anthropic released organization-wide management tools alongside partner-built skills from:

- Atlassian
- Figma
