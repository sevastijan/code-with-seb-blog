I'm a passionate Software Engineer with nearly 10 years of experience specializing in frontend development and user interface design. I excel at building responsive, engaging, and user-friendly web applications using modern frameworks and technologies. I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code that directly enhances the user experience and ensures long-term scalability.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work in both small, dynamic teams and large-scale corporate environments. I thrive in cross-functional collaboration, combining technical expertise with clear communication to drive projects forward. Adapting to different team cultures comes naturally to me, and I’m always focused on delivering high-quality results, no matter the project scale.

I’m equally comfortable working remotely or on-site, maintaining productivity and focus in any setting. I value creativity, innovation, and technical excellence, always looking for ways to optimize workflows and automate processes. For me, frontend development isn’t just about writing code—it’s about crafting seamless digital experiences that make a real impact.
